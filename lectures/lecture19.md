Struct initialization
=====================

The declaration of a struct variable may include an *initializer* to set initial values for the fields of the stuct variable.

Example:

{% highlight cpp %}
struct Point {
    double x;
    double y;
};

...

struct Point p = { 3.0, 4.5 }; // values are assigned to fields in order
printf("p.x = %lf\n", p.x);  // prints the value 3.0
printf("p.y = %lf\n", p.y);  // prints the value 4.5
{% endhighlight %}

Composition
===========

*Composition* is the technique of building a data type by *composing* other data types.

The idea is that simpler data types can serve as the building blocks for more complex data types.

For example, in a game, you might have a **Location** data type which describes locations on the game map:

{% highlight cpp %}
struct Location {
    int row; // a row of the map
    int col; // a column of the map
};
{% endhighlight %}

You could define some useful operations for this data type, i.e. functions which have one or more parameters which are **Location**s (or pointers to **Location**s.) For example:

{% highlight cpp %}
// Change given Location so that its column is
// changed by dx and its row is changed by dy.
void moveLocation(struct Location *loc, int dx, int dy)
{
    loc->row += dy;
    loc->col += dx;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, let's say we are defining a **Player** data type to represent the data concerning the player's character in the game. One piece of information that the game will need to keep track of for the player character is where on the map the player character is. So, we can use composition to place an instance of the **Location** data type inside the **Player** data type:

{% highlight cpp %}
struct Player {
    struct Location loc; // the player character's location
    int hitPoints;       // player character's hit points
};
{% endhighlight %}

We can visualize this composition as follows:

A **Player** instance has two fields, a **Location** called **loc** and an **int** called **hitPoints**. Because **loc** is itself a struct instance, it has fields of its own: an **int** called **row** and an **int** called **col**.

Because the **Player** data type builds on the **Location** data type, the functions (operations) you defined to work with **Location** instances can be used to help to implement functions which perform operations on **Player** instances. For example:

{% highlight cpp %}
void movePlayer(struct Map *map, struct Player *player, int dx, int dy)
{
    struct Location nextLoc;

    // set nextLoc to the location the player is trying to move to
    nextLoc = player->loc;
    moveLocation(&nextLoc, dx, dy);

    // determine if this is a legal move
    if (isLegalMove(map, nextLoc)) {
        // legal: player moves
        player->loc = nextLoc;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The **movePlayer** function computes the **Location** the player is trying to move to, determines whether the new location is a legal location, and, if so, updates the player's **Location**.
