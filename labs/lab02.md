Getting started
===============

Refer to [Lab 1](lab01.html) if you need a reminder about how to start **Cygwin Terminal** or **Notepad++**.

Start by downloading [CS101\_Lab02.zip](CS101_Lab02.zip), saving it in the directory **H:\\CS101**.

Start a **Cygwin Terminal** and run the following commands:

    cd h:
    cd CS101
    unzip CS101_Lab02.zip
    cd CS101_Lab02

Using **Notepad++**, open the file

> **H:\\CS101\\CS101\_Lab02\\Calculator.cpp**

Run the command

    make

when you are ready to compile the program. To run the program, run the command

    ./Calculator.exe

Expensive Calculator
====================

Your task in this lab is to first read two **double** values from the user, and print out their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Then read two **int** values from the user, and print out their quotient and modulus.

Here is an example run of the program (user input in **bold**):

<pre>
Enter first decimal value: <b>8.5</b>
Enter second decimal value: <b>4</b>
8.500 + 4.000 = 12.500
8.500 - 4.000 = 4.500
8.500 x 4.000 = 34.000
8.500 / 4.000 = 2.125

Enter first integer value: <b>7</b>
Enter second integer value: <b>3</b>
7 / 3 = 2
7 % 3 = 1

Thank you for using the expensive calculator.
</pre>

Each double quantity should be printed with three digits of precision after the decimal point.

Hints
=====

Store the first two input values in variables of type **double**.

Store the second two input values in variables of type **int**.

Use the **printf** function to prompt the user for the two values and also to print out the computed results. The **%f** conversion specifier may be used to print values of type **double**, and the **%i** conversion specifier may be used to print values of type **int**.

Note that to print a percent sign (%) character using **printf** you need to put *two* percent characters in the formatting string. For example

    printf("%%");

would print a single % character in the output window.

Use the **scanf** function to read values typed by the user into your **double** and **int** variables. Use the **%lf** conversion specifier (that's "percent", "lower-case L","lower-case F") for the **double** values and **%i** for the integer values. Note: the **%f** conversion specifier will not work correctly for a **double** variable. Do not forget the **&** before the variable in the **scanf** statements.
