title: "Lab 10: Fancy Rectangle"

Getting Started
===============

Refer to [Lab 1](lab01.html) if you need a reminder about how to start **Cygwin Terminal** or **Notepad++**.

Start by downloading [CS101\_Lab10.zip](CS101_Lab10.zip), saving it in the directory **H:\\CS101**.

Start a **Cygwin Terminal** and run the following commands:

    cd h:
    cd CS101
    unzip CS101_Lab10.zip
    cd CS101_Lab10

Using **Notepad++**, open the file

> **H:\\CS101\\CS101\_Lab10\\FancyRectangle.cpp**

Your task
=========

Your task is to draw a rectangle of a size (number of rows and columns) specified by the user.

The rectangle should have a "special" character (specified by the user) at the corners of the rectangle, inset by one row and column from the edges.

Example run (user input in **bold**):

<pre>Number of rows: <b>12</b>
Number of columns: <b>35</b>
Special character: <b>O</b>

...................................
.O...............................O.
...................................
...................................
...................................
...................................
...................................
...................................
...................................
...................................
.O...............................O.
...................................</pre>

When you are ready to compile the program, in the Cygwin window type the command

    make

To run the program, in the Cygwin window type the command

    ./FancyRectangle.exe

Hints
=====

Suggested approach:

**(1)** First, write the code to prompt the user for the number of rows and columns and the "special" character.

You can read a single non-whitespace character into a variable as follows:

    char special;

    scanf(" %c", &special);

**Note**: there is a *single space* character preceeding the **%c** in the **scanf** format string.

**(2)** Add code to print a "solid" rectangle of the given size. I.e., don't worry about printing the "special" character at the corners.

You should use a pair of nested loops. The outer loop is responsible for generating all of the rows of output making up the rectangle. The inner loop is responsible for printing a single row of the rectangle by repeatedly printing a period (".") character.

The program will need to print a newline (**\\n**) character at the end of each row.

**(3)** Change the code that prints the period character so that it is an **if/else** statement of the following form:

The idea is that a condition (*should be a special character*) determines when the special character should be printed. You will need to think about how to specify this condition.

The code above assumes that the **char** variable called **special** stores the special character entered by the user.
